# Agnes Monorepo

This repository is the monorepo foundation for an AI assistant platform spanning backend, frontend, shared packages, and infrastructure.

## Quick Start
- Review the docs in `docs/` for architecture and workflow guidance.
- The monorepo uses pnpm workspaces for package management.

## Structure
- `apps/backend`: server runtime adapters and API surface.
- `apps/frontend`: React UI shell.
- `packages/shared`: shared TypeScript contracts and utilities.
- `infra/terraform`: infrastructure-as-code.

Each directory contains a small `README.md` for LLM-friendly context.
