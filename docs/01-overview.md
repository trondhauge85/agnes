# Overview

Agnes is designed as a TypeScript-first monorepo with shared packages, a portable backend, and a React frontend.

Guiding principles:
- Portable runtime targets (Workers, VMs, k8s).
- Separation of concerns with shared contracts where appropriate.
- Small documentation files for LLM-friendly context.
