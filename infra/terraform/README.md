# Terraform

This folder hosts infrastructure-as-code for the assistant platform.

## Conventions
- Keep environment-specific configurations in subfolders (e.g., `envs/dev`).
- Prefer modules in `modules/` to share infrastructure patterns.
- Document each environment in a short `README.md` for LLM context.
